# Class To Form

Any help or suggestion is very welcome.

Introduction
------------

Class To Form is a console application in C # that creates a WindowsForm also in C # and uses as a base the variables of a Class to create the fields of a form, and creates two functions, one to get the data and set in the object and the other to pass the object values to the fields.

The idea is to make the creation of screens faster by making only the class and at most organizing the screens in the graphic part.

How to use

"Class To Form.exe" path/class.cs<br><br>
Result :<br><br>
Created FormClassUsers.cs<br>
Created FormClassUsers.Designer.cs
